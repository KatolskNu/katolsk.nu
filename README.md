# Katolsk.Nu

[Katolsk.Nu](https://katolsk.nu) is an open source blog for Catholic apologetics in Swedish. It is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on Gitub Pages.

# QA
## Why ?
There is a lack of Catholic content in Swedish. It is technically not an issue as the majority of Swedes can speak English, but the theological vocabulary makes it less accessible. I believe that having content in Swedish will make it easier for people to find answers to their questions.

## How does it work ?
The content is mainly composed of translations of [Catholic Answers](https://www.catolic.com) from English to Swedish. It is initially translated with an AI first and then manually reviewed. A big thanks to CatholicAnswers for their permission to translate their content!

## I want to help !
**We need reviewers!** The goal of a reviewer is to read and correct the machine translated text. You will just need to make sure that the text makes sense and that it uses the correct terms. You do not have to be perfectionist. You can contact us at contact@katolsk.nu

**We also need recomendations of content to prioritise !** Open a new issue [here](https://github.com/KatolskNu/katolsk.nu/issues/new) and describe what kind of content you would like to see (ex: objections to Mary, protestantism, etc...).


## I found a translation error or a typo !
Thank you ! You can either open a new issue or submit a pull request.

## A post does not make sense at all !
The translation result is usually pretty good and need little correction but some problems might appear on more advanced content. Just [open a new issue](https://github.com/KatolskNu/katolsk.nu/issues/new), so that we will try to fix it or delete it.
